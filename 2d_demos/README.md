the initial screenshot:

Was running into middle box issue because I was viewing 2 stuffs on the screen.
Removing them from the screen allowed to view only one item from the screen.

And then I calculated the amplitude using sqrt(real^2+img^2)

this generated the results as shown in the given screenshot.

the final screenshot is as shown follows after applying the amplitude:

After changing the file namings the following screenshot was received:

Everything was working fine.

# demo_001

The simulation was a little slower as compared to the above one

This is when the rendering happened.
